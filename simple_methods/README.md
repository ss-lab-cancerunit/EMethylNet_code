# Simple methods
----------------

Using simple methods (logistic regression and SVMs) to classify cancer type.

## Make the classifiers:
- create\_classifiers.ipynb. Can make logistic regression and SVM models, either binary for all cancer types or a multiclass model.

## Test the classifiers:
- load_and_eval.ipynb. Loads a given simple model and calculates performance on the test set.

## Do a hyperparameter search:
- Hyperparam_search.ipynb. Uses RandomizedSearchCV to perform hyperparameter searches. This file also includes my notes when choosing hyperparameters.
