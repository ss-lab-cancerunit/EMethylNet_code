# Pathways

Here, we explore pathways that are enriched in the multiclass genes. `KEGGPathwayAnalysis.Rmd` finds enriched KEGG pathways, and makes a graph for visualising them. This graph was then loaded into cytoscape for visualisation (`kegg_pathway_plot.cys` and `kegg_pathway_plot.pdf`).
We also visualise individual KEGG pathways in `visualising_enriched_kegg_pathways`, with a focus on the Pathways in cancer pathway (hsa05200).
