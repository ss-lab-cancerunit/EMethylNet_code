# Commands I ran to get all_lncRNA_output.json:

Download the 4 million cancer abstracts:
We did this in biology/pangea/ so we can use the xml file there.

The number of PubMed cancer articles (4227582) used in the command was correct on November 2020.

Then take the abstracts that mention at least one of the lncRNAs in the multiclass genes and a keyword (lncRNA_cancer_stems)

papers-parser local --genes ../multiclass_lncRNAs.txt --relations lncRNA_cancer_stems.txt --synonyms 'default' --model rules --output lncRNA_output ../../pangea/livius_output/cancer_output.xml
